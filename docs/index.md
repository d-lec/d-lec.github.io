# Welcome to the D-Lev Engineering Collective!

This is a website to document the D-Lev digital theremin.  
More text will go here. Also probably pictures.

## How to update the site

* install requirements: `pip install mkdocs; pip install mkdocs-terminal`
* `mkdocs serve` - Start the live-reloading docs server.
* `mkdocs build` - Build the documentation site.
* `mkdocs -h` - Print help message and exit.

or... push live to github and let github actions take care of it. YOLO.
